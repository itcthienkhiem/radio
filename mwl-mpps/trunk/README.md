A manageble server working as a Modality Worklist Server (MWL) &  Modality Performed Procedure Server (MPPS) (Dicom V3) built on the top of ClearCanvas Framework.
The first version was done in 2008 with vs2008 and I am aiming to share this work and upgrade it the last ClearCanvas framework & Ms DotNet 4.5.  
The mwl and mpps server code IS NOT CERTIFIED DICOM Compliant.
